    """ 
    Calculates the homography of two planes, from the plane defined by X 
    to the plane defined by Y. In this assignment, X are the coordinates of the
    four corners of the soccer goal while Y are the four corners of the penn logo

    Input:
        X: 4x2 matrix of (x,y) coordinates of goal corners in video frame
        Y: 4x2 matrix of (x,y) coordinates of logo corners in penn logo
